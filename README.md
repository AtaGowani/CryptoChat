## Project Structure 
Our project is divided into three components (`Backend`, `Frontend`, `Messaging`) as described by the folders in this repository.
This project will follow a microservices-like architecture with each of the components and it's code will be divided into seperate services which will make sure it can communicate with and accept communication from other services.
