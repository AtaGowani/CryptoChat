Please refer to the project structure below for a better representation of the different component at play. Instructions to run each component can be found in its respective directory. `cd` into each directory and follow the intructions under `README.md` to execute each component.

## Project Structure 
Our project is divided into three components (`Backend`, `Frontend`, `Messaging`) as described by the folders in this repository.
This project will follow a microservices-like architecture with each of the components and it's code will be divided into separate services which will make sure it can communicate with and accept communication from other services.
